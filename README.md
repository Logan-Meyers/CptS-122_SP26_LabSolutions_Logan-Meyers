## Constraints

A couple notes:
- This repo is purely for **educational purposes**. You may use this for inspiration and reference only. I.e., no blatant copy + paste into assignments, PAs, etc.
- This repo will be updated at the end of each week (Friday or Saturday), _after_ all the labs for the class have taken place. The reason for the delay is for obvious reasons.
- This repo will disappear at the end of the semester, also for obvious reasons.

## Layout & Solutions
