# CptS-122_SP26_LabSolutions_Logan-Meyers

My solutions to the lab tasks, and possibly some other things.

_If you need some inspiration on how to solve a task, here's a decent place to look!_

## How to Use

Each lab's solution with be available as an individual "Release" for this repo ([here is the releases page](https://github.com/Logan-Meyers/CptS-122_SP26_LabSolutions_Logan-Meyers/releases)). You may download the .zip solution and view the solutions in Visual Studio 2026.

Alternatively, you can download the whole repo and get access to all the solutions.

## Constraints

A couple notes:
- This repo is purely for **educational purposes**. You may use this for inspiration and reference only. I.e., no blatant copy + paste into assignments, PAs, etc.
- This repo will be updated at the end of each week (Friday or Saturday most likely), _after_ all the labs for the class have taken place. The reason for the delay is for obvious reasons.
- This repo will disappear at the end of the semester, unless Andy says otherwise.

## Layout & Solutions

Layout of files and projects, plus a date:

```
